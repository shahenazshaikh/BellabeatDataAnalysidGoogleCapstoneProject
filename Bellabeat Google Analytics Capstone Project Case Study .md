The data is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data which is Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius. This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

## 5. Limitations
- The data samples only 30 users.
- The data is outdated dating back to 2016 and has been collected by third party.
- The data does not include demographic information of users.

## 6. Recommendations
- From the above analysis, it is drawn that average steps taken by users on daily basis are 7000 while recommended is 10000. So most of the users fall into light active category. We can recommend the notification from Bellabeat app that encourages participants to walk at least 10000 steps a day.
- On weekends, we can held competitions among users within app to complete challenges like walking, running or even eating healthy food. On completing the challenge, they will get discount for annual subscription. This will not only motivate users to stay active on weekends, but also increase annual subscription of Bellabeat app.
- There are only 8 participants recording their weight. So, weight and BMI tracking features need to be improved. So, more users are encouraged to track their weight and understand BMI to live a healthy lifestyle.
- Within app, control needs to be provided to users that allow them to record their sleep pattern and provide suggestions to improve their sleep at night.
- Occasional tips about healthy eating, meditation and healthy habits can be provided within app as a general guidance.
